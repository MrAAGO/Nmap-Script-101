# Nmap-Script-101

This code will scan the network 192.168.1.0/24 using nmap with the -T4, -p-, and -A arguments, and save the output to a file named nmap_output.txt. You can customize the target network and arguments to suit your needs.

Note: Make sure that the nmap command is available in your system's PATH. If it is not, you will need to specify the full path to the nmap executable in the subprocess.run() call.
